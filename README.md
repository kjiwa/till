Prerequisites
-------------

1. Closure Compiler (https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
2. node.js (http://nodejs.org/)

Installation
------------

Run the following from the source directory.

`$ npm install
$ grunt`

This will compile and install the application into out/. Note you may need to run `node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt` instead of simply running `grunt`.

Running

Simply run the application by invoking out/main.py.

`$ python main.py`

By default the application serves on port 8080.
